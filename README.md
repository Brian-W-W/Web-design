This project is a tennis club members website that gives details about the members of the club(group).
We made a simple django project to practice django skills we learnt during the INTE 432  course work about issues in web design.
Our main focus was the navigation in the pages and members' details without complications.
It was enjoyable learning django. Looking forward to uploading more projects to sharpen our skills.
Thank you.
